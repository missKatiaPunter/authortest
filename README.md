## What is Tape?

**Tape** is a library for testing JavaScript code. It was written by **James Halliday**, aka [*substack*](https://substack.net/). Full code and the original documentation can be found [*here*](https://github.com/substack/tape).

Being a beginner friendly framework, Tape is great for learning to write unit tests. Unit tests are small, automated tests that check the behavior of individual units. A unit is often, if not usually, a single function. In order to be testable a function should produce predictable results. Expected value *5*, for instance can be used to test function
```js
function addTwoAndThree() {
  return 2+3;
}
```
